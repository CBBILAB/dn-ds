# dn-ds
To find Syn/NonSyn Mutation, (dN/dS values) by pairwise comparison of two input sequences


Program is written in C programing language and compiled using code blocks version 12.11 in windows 10 operating system

Sample gene sequences are given in two input files in fasta format, File1_Ec.txt and File2_Se.txt
File1_Ec.txt contains 32 gene sequences of E.coli and
File2_Se.txt contains 32 gene sequences of S. Enterica
In both the files genes are arranged in same order.
Corresponding genes of both the organisms are equal in size.
Program calculates result as No. of Syn Mutations, NonSyn Mutations, SynSite, NonSynSite and dN/dS
and stores the result in a output file dNdS_Result.txt
